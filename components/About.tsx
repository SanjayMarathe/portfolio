            I'm a Computer Science and Intelligent Systems student at UC Irvine, passionate about building 
            the future of technology at the intersection of full-stack development and artificial intelligence. 
            My work focuses on creating scalable systems, intelligent agents, and high-impact web products 
            that push the boundaries of what's possible. With experience spanning backend infrastructure, 
            agentic AI systems, and modern web frameworks, I'm driven by the ambition to architect solutions 
            that make a meaningful difference. Whether it's designing robust APIs, implementing cutting-edge 
            AI workflows, or building seamless user experiences, I approach every project with a commitment 
            to excellence and innovation.
